=== NATURAL LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION ===

1. EQUIVALENCE CLASSES (A ~ B means A ≤ B and B ≤ A):
   Found 3 non-trivial equivalence class(es):
   - {{0,2} ~ {1,2} ~ {0,3} ~ {1,3}}
   - {{0,1,2} ~ {0,1,3}}
   - {{0,2,3} ~ {1,2,3}}

2. MINIMAL GENERATING EXTENSIONS (beyond monotonicity):
   Total extensions: 56
   After transitive reduction: 5

   The relation is generated by monotonicity plus:
   - {0,1,2} ≤ {0,1,3}
   - {3} ≤ {2}
   - {0,1,3} ≤ {0,1,2}
   - {0,2,3} ≤ {1,2,3}
   - {1,2,3} ≤ {0,2,3}

3. SUMMARY:
   Universe size: 4
   Powerset size: 16
   Equivalence classes: 11 (3 non-trivial)
   Minimal generators: 5 extension(s)

4. PLAIN ENGLISH:
   "The relation extends subset ordering by treating some non-subset pairs as equivalent with 5 additional ordering(s)."

=== NATURAL LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION ===

1. EQUIVALENCE CLASSES (A ~ B means A ≤ B and B ≤ A):
   Found 4 non-trivial equivalence class(es):
   - {{0} ~ {0,1} ~ {0,2} ~ {0,1,2} ~ {0,3} ~ {0,1,3} ~ {0,2,3} ~ {0,1,2,3}}
   - {{1} ~ {1,2} ~ {1,3} ~ {1,2,3}}
   - {{0,4} ~ {0,1,4} ~ {0,2,4} ~ {0,1,2,4} ~ {0,3,4} ~ {0,1,3,4} ~ {0,2,3,4} ~ {0,1,2,3,4}}
   - {{1,4} ~ {1,2,4} ~ {1,3,4} ~ {1,2,3,4}}

2. MINIMAL GENERATING EXTENSIONS (beyond monotonicity):
   Total extensions: 337
   After transitive reduction: 1

   The relation is generated by monotonicity plus:
   - {3,4} ≤ {2,4}

3. SUMMARY:
   Universe size: 5
   Powerset size: 32
   Equivalence classes: 12 (4 non-trivial)
   Minimal generators: 1 extension(s)

4. PLAIN ENGLISH:
   "The relation extends subset ordering by treating some non-subset pairs as equivalent with 1 additional ordering(s)."

=== NATURAL LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION ===

1. EQUIVALENCE CLASSES (A ~ B means A ≤ B and B ≤ A):
   Found 4 non-trivial equivalence class(es):
   - {{0,1} ~ {2} ~ {1,2}}
   - {{0,2} ~ {0,1,2}}
   - {{0,1,3} ~ {2,3} ~ {1,2,3}}
   - {{0,2,3} ~ {0,1,2,3}}

2. MINIMAL GENERATING EXTENSIONS (beyond monotonicity):
   Total extensions: 58
   After transitive reduction: 3

   The relation is generated by monotonicity plus:
   - {0} ≤ {3}
   - {0,1,2} ≤ {0,2}
   - {0,1,2,3} ≤ {0,2,3}

3. SUMMARY:
   Universe size: 4
   Powerset size: 16
   Equivalence classes: 10 (4 non-trivial)
   Minimal generators: 3 extension(s)

4. PLAIN ENGLISH:
   "The relation extends subset ordering by treating some non-subset pairs as equivalent with 3 additional ordering(s)."
